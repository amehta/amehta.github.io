      <description>A year ago, I fired up wire shark on my home network to check out the packet flow of the DHCP process. I closed all my browser windows and other chat/im services, and still noticed a lot of chatter on the network. One that got my particular attention was a packet that was related to the popular service dropbox. I had not updated/edited any files recently, so was surprised to see it.</description>

      <description>What is DHCP ? DHCP is a protocol used to provide an IP address to a device. It is also used to configure additional networking related parameters on the device like subnet mask, router, domain name, and dns server.
Why DHCP ? DHCP stands for dynamic host configuration protocol and so allows a device to get an IP address without any manual intervention as long as the dhcp client is enabled and running on the device.</description>
